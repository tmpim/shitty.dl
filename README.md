- `url` - The full URL of your host to be prepended to image paths. Trailing slash required.
- `listen` The port or unix sock to listen to. Can also be options object as [defined here](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_options_callback)
- `fileLength` Amount of characters in generated filenames. Default is 4.
- `pasteThemePath` Location of a theme for the paste syntax highlighter.

- `oidcScopes` Scopes to request from the OpenID Connect server.
- `oidcProviderName` Frontend name for the login link

## Custom names

You can implement your own custom naming function by creating a file called `custom-name.js` that exports a function that returns a filename. Here is an example:

```js
const _ = require("lodash");
const fs = require("fs");

const nouns = fs.readFileSync("nouns.txt").toString().split("\n");

module.exports = () => {
	const noun = _.sample(nouns);
	return (noun.match(/^[aeiou]/i) ? "an-" : "a-") + noun;
};
```

More examples for custom naming functions can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/Lemmmy/shitty.dl/tree/master/examples).

## Notes

* Ensure that the user you run the shitty.dl process as has write permissions to `imagePath`.
* Make sure your paste theme has the same scheme as your site - i.e. if your site is HTTPS, the theme must be HTTPS too.
* When running shitty.dl it is suggested to set `NODE_ENV=production` environmental variable to ensure any errors that might happen are not passed on in detail to end user.
